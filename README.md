## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use & Customize

- **Pages & Navigation:**
  - Add new screens in `app/(tabs)/` or `app/`.

- **Styling:**
  - Use Tailwind classes with NativeWind: `<View className="bg-blue-500 p-4">`
  - Edit `tailwind.config.js` for custom themes.
- **Assets:**
  - Replace icons and splash screens in `assets/images/`.
- **Components:**
  - Place reusable components in `components/ui/`.
- **Configuration:**
  - Edit `app.json` and `package.json` as needed.
